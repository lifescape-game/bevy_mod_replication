# Quick start

Write the same logic that works for both multiplayer and single-player.
The crate provides synchronization of components and network events between
server and clients using the [Renet](https://github.com/lucaspoffo/renet)
library for the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org).

## Initialization

You need to add [`ReplicationPlugins`] to your app:

```
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;

let mut app = App::new();
app.add_plugins((MinimalPlugins, ReplicationPlugins));
```

This group contains necessary replication stuff and sets up the server and client
plugins to let you host and join games from the same application.

If you are planning to separate client and server you can use
`disable()` to disable [`ClientPlugin`] or
[`ServerPlugin`]. You can also configure how often updates are sent from
server to clients with [`ServerPlugin`]'s [`TickPolicy`]:

```
# use bevy::prelude::*;
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# let mut app = App::new();
app.add_plugins((
    MinimalPlugins,
    ReplicationPlugins
        .build()
        .disable::<ClientPlugin>()
        .set(ServerPlugin {
            tick_policy: TickPolicy::MaxTickRate(60),
            ..Default::default()
        }),
));
```

The plugin handles Renet initialization, you don't need to add its plugins.

## Component replication

It's a process of sending component changes from server to clients in order to
keep the world in sync.

### Marking for replication

By default, no components are replicated. A component will be replicated if it has been registered for replication
**and** its entity has the [`Replication`] component.

In other words you need two things to start replication :

1. Register component type for replication. Component should implement
[`Serialize`](serde::Serialize) and [`Deserialize`](serde::Deserialize).
You can use [`AppReplicationExt::replicate()`] to register the component for replication:

```
# use bevy::prelude::*;
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins(ReplicationPlugins);
app.replicate::<DummyComponent>();

#[derive(Component, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct DummyComponent;
```

If your component contains an entity then it cannot be deserialized as is
because entity IDs are different on server and client. The client should do the
mapping. Therefore, to replicate such components properly, they need implement
[`MapNetworkEntities`] and registered using [`AppReplicationExt::replicate_mapped()`]:

```
# use bevy::prelude::*;
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
#[derive(Component, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct MappedComponent(Entity);

impl MapNetworkEntities for MappedComponent {
    fn map_entities<T: Mapper>(&mut self, mapper: &mut T) {
        self.0 = mapper.map(self.0);
    }
}
```

By default all components serialized with [`bincode`] using [`DefaultOptions`](bincode::DefaultOptions).
If your component doesn't implement serde traits or you want to serialize it partially
you can use [`AppReplicationExt::replicate_with`]:

```
use std::io::Cursor;
use bevy::{prelude::*, ptr::Ptr};
use bevy_replicon::{prelude::*, replicon_core::replication_rules};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins(ReplicationPlugins);
app.replicate_with::<Transform>(serialize_transform, deserialize_transform, replication_rules::remove_component::<Transform>);

/// Serializes only translation.
fn serialize_transform(
    component: Ptr,
    cursor: &mut Cursor<Vec<u8>>,
) -> bincode::Result<()> {
    // SAFETY: Function called for registered `ComponentId`.
    let transform: &Transform = unsafe { component.deref() };
    bincode::serialize_into(cursor, &transform.translation)
}

/// Deserializes translation and creates [`Transform`] from it.
fn deserialize_transform(
    entity: &mut EntityWorldMut,
    _entity_map: &mut ServerEntityMap,
    cursor: &mut Cursor<&[u8]>,
    _replicon_tick: RepliconTick,
) -> bincode::Result<()> {
    let translation: Vec3 = bincode::deserialize_from(cursor)?;
    entity.insert(Transform::from_translation(translation));

    Ok(())
}
```

2. You need to choose entities you want to replicate using [`Replication`]
component. Just insert it to the entity you want to replicate. Only components
marked for replication through [`AppReplicationExt::replicate()`]
will be replicated.

If you need to disable replication for a specific component on an entity,
you can call [`CommandDontReplicateExt::dont_replicate::<T>`] on it and replication will be skipped for `T`.

### Tick and fixed timestep games

The [`ServerPlugin`] sends replication data in `PostUpdate` any time the [`RepliconTick`] resource
changes. By default, its incremented in `PostUpdate` per the [`TickPolicy`].

If you set [`TickPolicy::Manual`], you can increment [`RepliconTick`] at the start of your
`FixedTimestep` game loop. This value can represent your simulation step, and is made available
to the client in the custom deserialization, despawn and component removal functions.

One use for this is rollback networking: you may want to rollback time and apply the update
for the tick frame, which is in the past, then resimulate.

### Mapping to existing client entities

If you want the server to replicate an entity into a client entity that was already spawned on a client, see [`ClientEntityMap`].

This can be useful for certain types of game. For example, spawning bullets on the client immediately without
waiting on replication.

### "Blueprints" pattern

The idea was borrowed from [iyes_scene_tools](https://github.com/IyesGames/iyes_scene_tools#blueprints-pattern).
You don't want to replicate all components because not all of them are
necessary to send over the network. Components that computed based on other
components (like `GlobalTransform`) can be inserted after replication.
This can be easily done using a system with an `Added` query filter.
This way, you detect when such entities are spawned into the world, and you can
do any additional setup on them using code. For example, if you have a
character with mesh, you can replicate only your `Player` component and insert
necessary components after replication. If you want to avoid one frame delay, put
your initialization systems to [`ClientSet::Receive`]:

```
# use std::io::Cursor;
# use bevy::{prelude::*, ptr::Ptr};
# use bevy_replicon::{prelude::*, replicon_core::replication_rules};
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins(ReplicationPlugins);
app.replicate_with::<Transform>(serialize_transform, deserialize_transform, replication_rules::remove_component::<Transform>)
    .replicate::<Player>()
    .add_systems(PreUpdate, player_init_system.after(ClientSet::Receive));

fn player_init_system(
    mut commands: Commands,
    mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,
    mut materials: ResMut<Assets<ColorMaterial>>,
    spawned_players: Query<Entity, Added<Player>>,
) {
    for entity in &spawned_players {
        commands.entity(entity).insert((
            GlobalTransform::default(),
            VisibilityBundle::default(),
            meshes.add(Mesh::from(shape::Capsule::default())),
            materials.add(Color::AZURE.into()),
        ));
    }
}

#[derive(Component, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct Player;
# fn serialize_transform(_: Ptr, _: &mut Cursor<Vec<u8>>) -> bincode::Result<()> { unimplemented!() }
# fn deserialize_transform(_: &mut EntityWorldMut, _: &mut ServerEntityMap, _: &mut Cursor<&[u8]>, _: RepliconTick) -> bincode::Result<()> { unimplemented!() }
```

This pairs nicely with server state serialization and keeps saves clean.
You can use [`replicate_into`](scene::replicate_into) to
fill `DynamicScene` with replicated entities and their components.

### Component relations

Sometimes components depend on each other. For example, `Parent` and
`Children`. In this case, you can't just replicate the `Parent` because you
not only need to add it to the `Children` of the parent, but also remove it
from the `Children` of the old one. In this case, you need to create a third
component that correctly updates the other two when it changes, and only
replicate that one. This crate provides [`ParentSync`] component that replicates
Bevy hierarchy. For your custom components with relations you need to write your
own with a similar pattern.

## Network events

Network event replace RPCs (remote procedure calls) in other engines and,
unlike components, can be sent both from server to clients and from clients to
server.

### From client to server

To send specific events from client to server, you need to register the event
with [`ClientEventAppExt::add_client_event()`] instead of `add_event()`.
These events will appear on server as [`FromClient`] wrapper event that
contains sender ID and the sent event. We consider the authority machine
(a single-player session or you are a server) to be a client with ID
[`SERVER_ID`], so in this case the [`FromClient`] will be emitted too.
This way your game logic will work the same on client, server and in
single-player session.

Events include [`EventType`] to configure delivery guarantees (reliability and
ordering). You can alternatively pass in `SendType` from Renet directly if you
need to configure resend time.

```
# use bevy::prelude::*;
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins(ReplicationPlugins);
app.add_client_event::<DummyEvent>(EventType::Ordered)
    .add_systems(Update, event_sending_system);

fn event_sending_system(mut dummy_events: EventWriter<DummyEvent>) {
    dummy_events.send_default()
}

fn event_receiving_system(mut dummy_events: EventReader<FromClient<DummyEvent>>) {
    for FromClient { client_id, event } in dummy_events.read() {
        info!("received event {event:?} from client {client_id}");
    }
}

#[derive(Debug, Default, Deserialize, Event, Serialize)]
struct DummyEvent;
```

Just like components, if an event contains an entity, then the client should
map it before sending it to the server.
To do this, use [`ClientEventAppExt::add_mapped_client_event()`] and implement [`MapNetworkEntities`]:

```
# use bevy::prelude::*;
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins(ReplicationPlugins);
app.add_mapped_client_event::<MappedEvent>(EventType::Ordered);

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Event, Serialize)]
struct MappedEvent(Entity);

impl MapNetworkEntities for MappedEvent {
    fn map_entities<T: Mapper>(&mut self, mapper: &mut T) {
        self.0 = mapper.map(self.0);
    }
}
```

There is also [`ClientEventAppExt::add_client_event_with()`] to register an event with special sending and receiving functions.
This could be used for sending events that contain `Box<dyn Reflect>`, which require access to the `AppTypeRegistry` resource.
Don't forget to validate the contents of every `Box<dyn Reflect>` from a client, it could be anything!

### From server to client

A similar technique is used to send events from server to clients. To do this,
register the event with [`ServerEventAppExt::add_server_event()`] server event
and send it from server using [`ToClients`]. This wrapper contains send
parameters and the event itself. Just like events sent from the client,
they will be emitted locally on the server (if [`SERVER_ID`] is not excluded
from the send list):

```
# use bevy::prelude::*;
# use bevy_replicon::prelude::*;
# use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins(ReplicationPlugins);
app.add_server_event::<DummyEvent>(EventType::Ordered)
    .add_systems(Update, event_sending_system);

fn event_sending_system(mut dummy_events: EventWriter<ToClients<DummyEvent>>) {
    dummy_events.send(ToClients {
        mode: SendMode::Broadcast,
        event: DummyEvent,
    });
}

fn event_receiving_system(mut dummy_events: EventReader<DummyEvent>) {
    for event in dummy_events.read() {
        info!("received event {event:?} from server");
    }
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, Default, Deserialize, Event, Serialize)]
struct DummyEvent;
```

Just like with client events, if the event contains an entity, then
[`ServerEventAppExt::add_mapped_server_event()`] should be used instead.

For events that require special sending and receiving functions you can use [`ServerEventAppExt::add_server_event_with()`].

## Server and client creation

To connect to the server or create it, you need to initialize the
[`RenetClient`] and [`NetcodeClientTransport`](renet::transport::NetcodeClientTransport) **or**
[`RenetServer`] and [`NetcodeServerTransport`](renet::transport::NetcodeServerTransport) resources from Renet.
All Renet API is re-exported from this plugin.

Never create client and server resources in the same app for single-player, it will cause replication loop.
Use the described pattern instead.

The only part of it that handled by this plugin is channels that used for
events and component replication. These channels should be obtained from the
[`NetworkChannels`] resource. So when creating server you need to initialize
[`ConnectionConfig`](renet::ConnectionConfig) like this:

```
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy_replicon::{prelude::*, renet::ConnectionConfig};

# let mut app = App::new();
# app.add_plugins(ReplicationPlugins);
let network_channels = app.world.resource::<NetworkChannels>();
let connection_config = ConnectionConfig {
    server_channels_config: network_channels.get_server_configs(),
    client_channels_config: network_channels.get_client_configs(),
    ..Default::default()
};
```

For full example of how to initialize server or client see the example in the
repository.

## System sets and conditions

When configuring systems for multiplayer game, you often want to run some
systems only on when you have authority over the world simulation
(on server or in single-player session). For example, damage registration or
procedural level generation systems. For this just add [`has_authority()`]
condition on such system. If you want your systems to run only on
frames when server send updates to clients use [`ServerSet::Send`].

To check if you running server or client, you can use conditions based on
[`RenetClient`] and [`RenetServer`] resources.
They rarely used for gameplay systems (since you write the same logic for
multiplayer and single-player!), but could be used for server
creation / connection systems and corresponding UI.

## Eventual consistency

All events, inserts, removals and despawns will be applied to clients in the same order as on the server.

Entity component updates are grouped by entity, and component groupings may be applied to clients in a different order than on the server.
For example, if two entities are spawned in tick 1 on the server and their components are updated in tick 2,
then the client is guaranteed to see the spawns at the same time, but the component updates may appear in different client ticks.

If a component is dependent on other data, updates to the component will only be applied to the client when that data has arrived.
So if your component references another entity, updates to that component will only be applied when the referenced entity has been spawned on the client.

Updates for despawned entities will be discarded automatically, but events or components may reference despawned entities and should be handled with that in mind.

Clients should never assume their world state is the same as the server's on any given tick value-wise.
World state on the client is only "eventually consistent" with the server's.

## Limits

To reduce packet size there are the following limits per replication update:

- Up to [`u16::MAX`] entities that have added components with up to [`u16::MAX`] bytes of component data.
- Up to [`u16::MAX`] entities that have changed components with up to [`u16::MAX`] bytes of component data.
- Up to [`u16::MAX`] entities that have removed components with up to [`u16::MAX`] bytes of component data.
- Up to [`u16::MAX`] entities that were despawned.
