# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Optional `ClientDiagnosticsPlugin`, which writes diagnostics every second.

### Changed

- Optimize despawn tracking.
- Rename `reflect` event registration methods into `seed`. This is more correct because it can be used not only for reflection.
- Hide `id` field in `EventChannel` and add `Clone` and `Copy` impls for it.

## [0.14.0] - 2023-10-05

### Added

- The ability to pre-spawn entities on client.

### Changed

- Rename `NetworkEntityMap` to `ServerEntityMap`.

## [0.13.0] - 2023-10-04

### Added

- The ability to set custom despawn and component removal functions.
- `TickPolicy::EveryFrame` to update `RepliconTick` every frame.

### Changed

- Use more compact varint encoding for entities.
- Now all replication functions accept `RepliconTick`.
- Rename `NetworkTick` into `RepliconTick` and move it into `server` module.
- Fix crash with several entities spawned and updated.
- Rename `LastTick` into `LastRepliconTick`.
- Fix the entire world was always sent instead of changes.

### Removed

- `derive_more` dependency.

## [0.12.0] - 2023-10-01

### Added

- High-level API to extract replicated entities into `DynamicScene`.

### Changed

- Hide `ReplicationRules` from public API.
- Move logic related to replication rules to `replicon_core::replication_rules` module.

## [0.11.0] - 2023-09-25

### Changed

- Serialize all components and events using varint.
- Serialize entities in optimal way by writing its index and generation as separate varints.
- Hide `ReplicationId`, `ReplicationInfo` and related methods from `ReplicationRules` from public API.
- Rename `ReplicationRules::replication_id` into `ReplicationRules::replication_marker_id`.
- Use serialization buffer cache per client for replication.
- Correctly handle old values on packet reordering.
- Bevy's `Tick` was replaced with dedicated type `NetworkTick` that increments on server update, so it can be used to provide information about time. `AckedTick` was replaced with `ServerTicks` that also contains mappings from `NetworkTick` to Bevy's `Tick` and current `NetworkTick`.
- Functions in `AppReplicationExt::replicate_with` now accept bytes cursor for memory reuse and return serialization errors.
- Rename `ReplicationCore` into `RepliconCore` with its module for clarity.
- `MapNetworkEntities` now accepts generic `Mapper` and doesn't have error handling and deserialiation functions now accept `NetworkEntityMap`. This allowed us to lazily map entities on client without extra allocation.
- Make `LastTick` public.

## [0.10.0] - 2023-09-13

### Changed

- `MapEventEntities` was renamed into `MapNetworkEntities` and now used for both components and events. Built-in `MapEntities` trait from Bevy is not suited for network case for now.
- `AppReplicationExt::not_replicate_with` was replaced with component marker `Ignored<T>`.
- Reflection was replaced with plain serialization. Now components need to implement serde traits and no longer need any reflection. This reduced reduced message sizes a lot. Because of this mapped components now need to be registered with `AppReplicationExt::replicate_mapped`.
- Derive `Clone` and `Copy` for `Replication`.
- Make `ServerPlugin` fields private and add `ServerPlugin::new`.
- Make `AckedTicks` public.
- Make `NetworkEntityMap` public.

## [0.9.1] - 2023-08-05

### Changed

- Fix event cleanup.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-08-01

### Added

- `ClientSet` now available from `prelude`.

### Changed

- Move `has_authority()` to `server` module.

## [0.8.0] - 2023-07-28

### Changed

- Put systems in `PreUpdate` and `PostUpdate` to avoid one frame delay.
- Reorganize `ServerSet` and move client-related systems to `ClientSet`.

## [0.7.1] - 2023-07-20

### Changed

- Re-export `transport` module from `bevy_renet`.

## [0.7.0] - 2023-07-20

### Changed

- Update to `bevy` 0.11.
- Mappable network events now need to implement `MapEventEntities` instead of `MapEntities`.

### Removed

- `ClientState` and `ServerState`, use conditions from `bevy_renet` and `resource_added()` / `resource_exists()` / `resource_removed()`.
- `ServerSet::Authority`, use `has_authority()` instead.

## [0.6.1] - 2023-07-09

### Changed

- Update `ParentSync` in `CoreSet::PostUpdate` to avoid one frame delay.

## [0.6.0] - 2023-07-08

### Added

- `SendPolicy` added to API of event-creation for user control of delivery guarantee (reliability and ordering).

### Changed

- `ParentSync` no longer accepts parent entity and just synchronizes hierarchy automatically if present.

## [0.5.0] - 2023-06-26

### Added

- `ServerSet::ReceiveEvent` and `ServerSet::SendEvent` for more fine-grained control of scheduling for event handling.

### Changed

- Update server to use `TickPolicy` instead of requiring a tick rate.

### Fixed

- Unspecified system ordering could cause tick acks to be ordered on the wrong side of world diff handling.
- Crash after adding events without `ServerPlugin` or `ClientPlugin`.

## [0.4.0] - 2023-05-26

### Changed

- Swap `registry` and `event` arguments in `BuildEventSerializer` for consistency with `ReflectSerializer`.
- Update to `bevy_renet` 0.0.12.

## [0.3.0] - 2023-04-15

### Added

- Support for sending events that contains `Box<dyn Reflect>` via custom serialization implementation.

### Changed

- Accept receiving system in `add_client_event_with` and sending system in `add_server_event_with`.
- Make `EventChannel<T>` public.

## [0.2.3] - 2023-04-09

### Fixed

- Panic that could occur when deleting `RenetServer` or `RenetClient` resources.

## [0.2.2] - 2023-04-05

### Fixed

- Do not panic if an entity was already despawned on client.

## [0.2.1] - 2023-04-02

### Fixed

- Incorrect last tick detection.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-04-01

### Changed

- Use `#[reflect(MapEntities)]` from Bevy 0.10.1 instead of custom `#[reflect(MapEntity)]`.

### Fixed

- Tick checks after overflow.
