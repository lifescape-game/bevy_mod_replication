### Changed

- Make `ReplicatedClients::new` public.

### Added

- `ServerEventAppExt::make_independent` to let events be triggered without waiting for replication on the same tick.
- `ConnectedClients` (the same name as the old resource that was renamed into `ReplicatedClients`) with client IDs for all connected clients (but may not be replicated yet).
- `ServerPlugin::replicate_after_connect` to enable replication right after connection (enabled by default, same as old behavior).

### Changed

- Rename `connected_clients` into `replicated_clients`.
- Rename `ConnectedClients` to `ReplicatedClients`.
- Rename `ConnectedClient` to `ReplicatedClient`.

### Fixed

- Emit an error instead of panic on events deserialization on client.

## [0.27.0] - 2024-07-04

### Changed

- Update to Bevy `0.14.0`.
- Move `bevy_replicon_renet` to a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/projectharmonia/bevy_replicon_renet).
- `ServerEventsPlugin` and `ClientEventsPlugin` can be disabled on client-only and server-only apps respectively.
- Put `ClientDiagnosticsPlugin` under `client_diagnostics` feature (disabled by default) and make it part of the `RepliconPlugins` group.
- Put `scene` module under `scene` feature (enabled by default).
- Put `parent_sync` module under `parent_sync` feature (enabled by default).
- Put `client` module under `client` feature (enabled by default).
- Put `server` module under `server` feature (enabled by default).
- `TestFnsEntityExt::serialize` now accepts `RepliconTick` for server tick instead of using `ServerTick` resource internally.
- Move `replicon_client`, `server_entity_map`, `replicon_server`, `connected_clients` under `core` module. These modules are needed for both client and server.
- Move `VisibilityPolicy` to `connected_clients` module.
- Move `server::events::event_data` module to `core::event_registry::server_event`.
- Move `client::events::event_data` module to `core::event_registry::client_event`.

- Move `ServerEventAppExt`, `server::events::SerializeFn`, `server::events::DeserializeFn`, `default_serialize`, `default_serialize_mapped`, `default_deserialize`, `ToClients` and `SendMode` to `core::event_registry::server_event`.
- Speedup removals caching.

### Fixed

- Do not divide values per seconds by the number of messages for `ClientDiagnosticsPlugin`.

## [0.26.3] - 2024-06-09

### Added

- Logging for sending and receiving messages.

### Changed

- Do not send empty ack messages from client.

## [0.26.2] - 2024-06-05

### Added

- `Debug`/`Clone` derives to `ServerEvent`.
- `Debug`/`Copy`/`Clone` derives to `TickPolicy`.
- `ClientSet::SyncHierarchy` for `ParentSync` updates.

## [0.26.1] - 2024-05-27

### Fixed

- Regression in server events reset logic.

## [0.26.0] - 2024-05-26

### Added

- `ClientEventsPlugin` and `ServerEventsPlugin` that are required for events (available from the `RepliconPlugins` group). Can be disabled if you don't use them.

### Changed

- Custom events are now registered with serialization and deserialization functions instead of systems. This makes the API more convenient since the purpose of custom systems was to customize serialization.
- All events are processed in one system instead of a separate system for each event. Bevy does a [similar optimization](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12936) for event updates. It won't be that noticeable since users register much fewer replicon events.
- Rename `ConnectedClient::change_tick` into `ConnectedClient::init_tick`.
- Rename `ConnectedClient::get_change_limit` into `ConnectedClient::get_change_tick`.
- Rename `Confirmed` into `ConfirmHistory`.
- Rename `replicon_channels` module into `channels`.
- Rename `replication_fns` and `ReplicationFns` into `replication_registry` and `ReplicationRegistry`.
- Rename "packets" into "messages" in client diagnostics.

### Fixed

- `bevy_replicon_renet` now properly sets `RepliconClientStatus::Connecting` when `RenetClient` is connecting.

## [0.25.3] - 2024-05-24

### Fixed

- Fix replication with a removal at the same tick.

## [0.25.2] - 2024-05-18

### Fixed

- Fix replicating previously spawned entities to a newly connected client with visibility policy different from `VisibilityPolicy::All`.

## [0.25.1] - 2024-05-16

### Fixed

- Fix possible overflow in `Confirmed::contains_any`.

## [0.25.0] - 2024-05-11

### Added

- `AppMarkerExt` to customize how components will be written based on markers present without overriding deserialization functions. Now third-party prediction crates could be integrated much easier.
- `AppRuleExt::replicate_group` and `GroupRegistration` trait to register and customize component groups. A group will be replicated only if all its components present on an entity.
- `ServerSet::StoreHierarchy` for systems that store hierarchy changes in `ParentSync`.
- More tracing.
- `Debug` impl for `RepliconClientStatus`.

### Changed

- `SerializeFn` now accepts regular `C` instead of `Ptr`.
- `DeserializeFn` now does only deserialization and returns `C`. Use the newly added marker-based API if you want to customize how component will be written. See docs for `AppMarkerExt` for details.
- Rename `AppReplicationExt` into `AppRuleExt`.
- `AppRuleExt::replicate_with` now accepts `RuleFns` struct with functions. You no longer can customize removals this way, use the mentioned marker-based API instead.
- Writing to entities on client now done via `EntityMut` and `Commands` instead of `EntityWorldMut`. It was needed to support the mentioned in-place deserialization and will possibly allow batching insertions in the future (for details see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/10154).
- Return iterator from `RepliconClient::receive` instead of popping the last message. If you used `while` loop with it before, replace it with `for`.
- Use new `ServerInitTick` resource on client instead of `RepliconTick`. If you used `ServerEventAppExt::add_server_event_with`, use `ServerInitTick` instead of `RepliconTick` in your receive function.
- Use new `ServerTick` resource on server instead of `RepliconTick`.
- Replace `ServerEntityTicks` with `Confirmed` component. The component now also stores whether the last 64 ticks were received.
- Now serialization/deserialization, removal, despawn and writing functions accept context to access additional information.
- Move `replicon_tick` module under `server` module since now it's used only on server.
- Move `Replication` to `core` module.
- Move all functions-related logic from `ReplicationRules` into a new `ReplicationFns` and hide `ReplicationRules` from public API.
- Move `despawn_recursive` into `replication_fns` module.
- Rename `serialize_component` into `default_serialize` and move into `rule_fns` module.
- Rename `deserialize_component` into `default_deserialize` and move into `rule_fns` module.
- Rename `deserialize_mapped_component` into `default_deserialize_mapped` and move into `rule_fns` module.
- Rename `remove_component` into `default_remove` and move into `command_fns` module.

### Removed

- `dont_replicate` module. Use the newly added `AppRuleExt::replicate_group` or newtypes.

### Fixed

- Reversed order of the received messages from `RepliconClient`.

## [0.24.1] - 2024-03-07

### Fixed

- Fix compilation issue when multiple `PartialEq` impls are present for `usize`.

## [0.24.0] - 2024-03-06

### Added

- Provide `ServerTestAppExt` extension trait for exchanging messaging between apps in tests.

### Changed

- Rename `Replication` into `Replicated`. Old name is still available via deprecated alias.
- Abstract out all I/O and `renet` dependency. We will continue to provide first-party integration with renet via `bevy_replion_renet`. But users can write their integration with other messaging libraries. So now users need to additionally add messaging-related plugin. In case of `bevy_replion_renet` it's `RepliconRenetPlugins`.
- Replace usage of `RenetServer` and `RenetClient` with our `RepliconServer` and `RepliconClient` respectively. Use types from `renet` (or other library) only when you need to connect / disconnect or write some library-specific logic. In other cases prefer using the newly provided types to make your code messaging-library independent. Unlike the old types from renet, these resources are always present in the world. So instead of using `resource_(exists/added/removed)` for network-related conditions, use special conditions provided in `common_conditions` module.
- Move `has_authority` to `common_conditions` module.
- Replace conditions from `renet` with ours, see `common_conditions` module. Available in `prelude`.
- Replace usage of `ClientId` from `renet` with our own with the same name. In user code only the one from `bevy_replicon` should be used.
- Replace `SERVER_ID` constant with `ClientId::SERVER`.
- Replace use of `RenetConnectionStatus` with our `RepliconClientStatus`.
- Replace `ServerEvent` from `renet` with our own with the same name. In user code only the one from `bevy_replicon` should be used.
- Rename `replicon_core` module into `core`.
- Rename `EventType` into `ChannelKind` and move into `core` module.
- Replace usage of renet's `SendType` with our `RepliconChannel`.
- Rename `NetworkChannels` into `RepliconChannels` and move into `replicon_channels` module.
- Rename `ReplicationChannel::Reliable` and `ReplicationChannel::Unreliable` into `ReplicationChannel::Init` and `ReplicationChannel::Update` respectively.
- Channel creation methods in `RepliconChannels` now accept `RepliconChannel` with full channel configuration.
- Make `default_max_bytes` field in `RepliconChannels` public.
- Move `RepliconChannels::get_server_configs` and `RepliconChannels::get_client_configs` to create channels configs for `renet` into `RenetChannelsExt` extension trait provided by `bevy_replion_renet`. Make sure to import it to use these methods.
- Move `ClientEntityMap` and `ClientMapping` to `client_entity_map` submodule.
- Rename `ReplicationPlugins` into `RepliconPlugins`.
- Rename `ClientCache` into `ConnectedClients`.
- Rename `ClientState` into `ConnectedClient`.
- Replace `RepliconChannels::set_client_max_bytes` and `RepliconChannels::set_server_max_bytes` with `RepliconChannels::server_channel_mut` and `RepliconChannels::client_channel_mut` respectively with more rich configuration.
- Move `ClientEventChannel` to `client_event` module.
- Move `ServerEventChannel` to `server_event` module.
- `ClientMapper`, `ServerEntityMap`, `BufferedUpdates`, `ReplicationRules`, `ReplicationChannel`, `ClientEventChannel`, `ServerEventChannel`, `ServerEventQueue` and `EventMapper` are no longer in `prelude` module. Import them directly.

### Fixed

- Misuse of `Vec::reserve` that would cause excess allocations.

## [0.21.2] - 2024-01-27

### Changes

- Increase publicity of `ClientState` API.

## [0.21.1] - 2024-01-22

### Added

- Control over client visibility of entities.

### Changed

- Rename `ClientInfo` into `ClientState`.
- Allow calling `dont_replicate::<T>` with the insertion of `T` instead of after `Replication` insertion.
- `dont_replicate::<T>` can panic only in `debug_assertions` is enabled.

## [0.20.0] - 2024-01-13

- Hide extra functionality from `ServerEventQueue`.
- Move server event reset system to new set `ClientSet::ResetEvents` in `PreUpdate`.
- Make `NetworkChannels` channel-creation methods public (`create_client_channel()` and `create_server_channel()`).

## [0.19.0] - 2024-01-07

### Added

- `renet_serde` feature which reexports `serde` feature from `bevy_renet`.
- `ClientSet::Reset` which can be disabled by external users.
- `ServerEntityMap::remove_by_client()` for manual client cleanup.
- `BufferedUpdates`, `ServerEntityTicks` to public API.

### Changed

- Move the client reset system to `PreUpdate` to let clients react more promptly to resets.

- Fix replication for entities when `Replication` component is added after spawn.

## [0.18.0] - 2023-12-19

### Changed

- Send all component mappings, inserts, removals and despawns over reliable channel in form of deltas and component updates over unreliable channel packed by packet size. This significantly reduces the possibility of packet loss.
- Replace `REPLICATION_CHANNEL_ID` with `ReplicationChannel` enum. The previous constant corresponded to the unreliable channel.
- Server events use tick with the last change instead of waiting for replication message without changes.
- Include despawns before removals to optimize space for case where despawns are presents and removals aren't.
- `TickPolicy::EveryFrame` and `TickPolicy::MaxTickRate` now increment tick only if `RenetServer` exists.

## [0.15.1] - 2023-10-22

### Changed

- Register `Replication` type and add `#[reflect(Component)]`.

## [0.15.0] - 2023-10-21

### Added

- `network_event::server_event::send` helper for server events in custom sending functions.
- Optional `ClientDiagnosticsPlugin`, which writes diagnostics every second.
- `Reflect` derive for `Replication`.

### Changed

- Optimize despawn tracking.
- Hide `id` field in `EventChannel` and add `Clone` and `Copy` impls for it.
- Remove special functions for reflect events and advise users to write them manually instead. Reflect events are easier now because sometimes you can directly use reflect serializers from Bevy instead of manually writing serde traits.
- Do no trigger server events before world update arrival.

### Removed

- `Debug` requirement for events.

## [0.14.0] - 2023-10-05

### Added

- The ability to pre-spawn entities on client.

### Changed

- Rename `NetworkEntityMap` to `ServerEntityMap`.

## [0.13.0] - 2023-10-04

### Added

- The ability to set custom despawn and component removal functions.
- `TickPolicy::EveryFrame` to update `RepliconTick` every frame.

### Changed

- Use more compact varint encoding for entities.
- Now all replication functions accept `RepliconTick`.
- Rename `NetworkTick` into `RepliconTick` and move it into `server` module.
- Rename `LastTick` into `LastRepliconTick`.

### Removed

- `derive_more` dependency.

### Fixed

- Fix the entire world was always sent instead of changes.
- Fix crash with several entities spawned and updated.

## [0.12.0] - 2023-10-01

### Added

- High-level API to extract replicated entities into `DynamicScene`.

### Changed

- Hide `ReplicationRules` from public API.
- Move logic related to replication rules to `replicon_core::replication_rules` module.

## [0.11.0] - 2023-09-25

### Changed

- Serialize all components and events using varint.
- Serialize entities in optimal way by writing its index and generation as separate varints.
- Hide `ReplicationId`, `ReplicationInfo` and related methods from `ReplicationRules` from public API.
- Rename `ReplicationRules::replication_id` into `ReplicationRules::replication_marker_id`.
- Use serialization buffer cache per client for replication.
- Correctly handle old values on packet reordering.
- Bevy's `Tick` was replaced with dedicated type `NetworkTick` that increments on server update, so it can be used to provide information about time. `AckedTick` was replaced with `ServerTicks` that also contains mappings from `NetworkTick` to Bevy's `Tick` and current `NetworkTick`.
- Functions in `AppReplicationExt::replicate_with` now accept bytes cursor for memory reuse and return serialization errors.
- Rename `ReplicationCore` into `RepliconCore` with its module for clarity.
- `MapNetworkEntities` now accepts generic `Mapper` and doesn't have error handling and deserialiation functions now accept `NetworkEntityMap`. This allowed us to lazily map entities on client without extra allocation.
- Make `LastTick` public.

## [0.10.0] - 2023-09-13

### Changed

- `MapEventEntities` was renamed into `MapNetworkEntities` and now used for both components and events. Built-in `MapEntities` trait from Bevy is not suited for network case for now.
- `AppReplicationExt::not_replicate_with` was replaced with component marker `Ignored<T>`.
- Reflection was replaced with plain serialization. Now components need to implement serde traits and no longer need any reflection. This reduced reduced message sizes a lot. Because of this mapped components now need to be registered with `AppReplicationExt::replicate_mapped`.
- Derive `Clone` and `Copy` for `Replication`.
- Make `ServerPlugin` fields private and add `ServerPlugin::new`.
- Make `AckedTicks` public.
- Make `NetworkEntityMap` public.

- `ServerSet::Authority`, use `has_authority()` instead.

## [0.6.1] - 2023-07-09

- Update `ParentSync` in `CoreSet::PostUpdate` to avoid one frame delay.

## [0.6.0] - 2023-07-08

### Added

- `SendPolicy` added to API of event-creation for user control of delivery guarantee (reliability and ordering).

### Changed

- `ParentSync` no longer accepts parent entity and just synchronizes hierarchy automatically if present.

## [0.5.0] - 2023-06-26

### Added

- `ServerSet::ReceiveEvent` and `ServerSet::SendEvent` for more fine-grained control of scheduling for event handling.

### Changed

- Update server to use `TickPolicy` instead of requiring a tick rate.

### Fixed

- Unspecified system ordering could cause tick acks to be ordered on the wrong side of world diff handling.
- Crash after adding events without `ServerPlugin` or `ClientPlugin`.
